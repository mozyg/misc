\section{Introduction}
Today, mobile devices run third party applications to perform complex tasks like web browsing, banking and gaming. Recent studies have found that smart-phones are the target of an increasing number of malware attacks \cite{bose2006mobile, cybercriminals2007banks, iphone2010seriot} and their security is important as personal data such as contacts, credit card numbers and passwords are often stored on the device. While some security models \cite{androidsecurity} provide process level isolation among applications, operating system bugs such as \cite{sms2009iphone,opencore2009android,kernel2009vulnerability} allow malicious applications to take over the device. Recent reports have even found that some smart phones had the Mariposa botnet pre-installed \cite{mariposa2009android}. Virtualization can be useful for secure isolation of third party code from confidential data and provides greater defense-in-depth against attacks on the system.\\

In recent years, virtual machines have become prevalent in cluster computing environments \cite{gartner2009virtual} as they provide isolation for shared usage of machines in a data center. As a result of hardware improvements, smart phone configurations found today resemble desktop machines from few years ago and many of them run commodity operating systems. There is a growing interest in academia \cite{cox2007pocket} and industry \cite{vmware2009nextfrontier} about the benefits of virtualization on these devices. Virtualization provides better security guarantees in mobile devices than current solutions offer. \\

Existing solutions for isolation of mobile applications introduce a Type I hypervisor \cite{mvp, okl4} which manages the phone's hardware and allows running multiple operating systems on top. Popular Type II hypervisors like KVM and QEMU either suffer from a large performance overhead (refer Section \ref{sec:discuss}) or are otherwise unusable. We propose to have isolated applications which are integrated with the host operating system's application launcher and do not suffer from a large performance penalty. In order to achieve this goal, we have an isolation framework running on the host operating system and a shared rendering engine for improved performance. 
%Since most of the mobile devices work on the ARM architecture, we plan to evaluate how different virtualization techniques perform on ARM.\\

%Our preliminary investigations evaluate the difference in performance between emulating ARM-on-ARM vs x86-on-ARM and our results show that ARM-on-ARM virtualization has much lower performance overhead, however, even ARM-on-ARM is prohibitively slow, and any machine emulation simply is not reasonable on a smartphone.  Given the large overheads of machine emulation, we had to explore alternative means of virtualization.  We looked into Xen and KVM, two popular virtualization solutions for x86, however we discovered that their implementations on ARM simply were nowhere near mature enough for our needs. \\

We adopt an OS-level virtualization tool called Linux Containers (LXC). Linux Containers present a low overhead technique of isolating a process within a container.  A container is made up of several namespace virtualization techniques, where the UID, user namespace, network resources etc. are virtualized in order to prevent the process inside the container from interfacing external data or resources.  Our tests show that the performance overhead is within 5-10\%, proving to be a promising balance between isolation and performance. \\

The rest of this report is structured as follows: Section \ref{sec:overview} presents an overview of the design and the next section describes in detail some of the design choices we make. Sections \ref{sec:impl} describes our implementation and deployment of \emph{\proj} on smartphones. Evaluation of our system is presented in Section \ref{sec:eval}. Section \ref{sec:related} discusses existing efforts in this area and section \ref{sec:future} discusses future work.\\
