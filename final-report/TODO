Introduction: Make it fit

Overview: Make it fit. A bit longer ?

Design: 
Add Linux containers as a separate section

Add subsections for UTSNAME, PID, IPC, USER, NETWORK, /proc, ro bind mount

Add a new subsection for unionfs and copy on write file systems
Add a DIAGRAM for containers
Add some design ideas for migration

Implementation:
Talk about binary modules, removing version checking etc
Check X stuff for quality control

Evaluation:
Add description about the experiments
Run Quake benchmark. Get a graph
Measure CPU and memory overhead in containers
(Re-run the numbers on one machine without xterm or X at all, except where required (are we reporting the x11perf numbers for containers?))
run lmbench. (talk to shivaram/will about modifying the Makefile appropriately)
