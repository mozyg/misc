\begin{abstract}
    Modern day smartphones are plagued with security vulnerabilities.  As smartphone adoption continues to increase, and more sensitive information is stored on them, there is an increasing need for a more secure solution.  We developed \emph{\proj}, a system for mobile devices that uses light-weight OS-level virtualization to contain and isolate applications in order to increase security on these devices.  Our system has negligible overhead (5-10\%), while providing strong security guarantees for the applications within.  \emph{\proj} is designed to be added to an existing mobile device to provide security guarantees for native applications while maintaining the original device experience.  Additionally, \emph{\proj} allows the use of desktop Linux applications on smartphones (while guaranteeing a secure execution context) enabling a much wider variety of applications to be run on mobile devices than would previously be possible.
