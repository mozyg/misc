\section{Introduction}
Modern mobile devices run third party applications to perform complex tasks like web browsing, banking and gaming. Recent studies have found that smart-phones are the target of an increasing number of malware attacks \cite{bose2006mobile, cybercriminals2007banks, iphone2010seriot} and their security is important as personal data such as contacts, credit card numbers and passwords are often stored on the device. While some security models \cite{androidsecurity} provide a stronger process level isolation among applications, operating system bugs such as \cite{sms2009iphone,opencore2009android,kernel2009vulnerability} allow malicious applications to take over the device. Virtualization can be useful for secure isolation of third party code from confidential data and provide greater defense-in-depth against attacks on the system.\\

In recent years, virtual machines have become prevalent in cluster computing environments \cite{gartner2009virtual} as they provide isolation for shared usage of machines in a data center. As a result of hardware improvements, smart phone configurations found today resemble desktop machines from few years ago and many of them run commodity operating systems. There is a growing interest in academia \cite{cox2007pocket} and industry \cite{vmware2009nextfrontier} about the benefits of virtualization on these devices. Virtualization provides better security guarantees in mobile devices than current solutions offer as well enabling useful applications like environment migration. \\

Migrating a system to a mobile device can take advantage of network or computation facilities that are closer to the user's location and provide the user with a consistent experience irrespective of the network connectivity. Environment migration has been studied earlier, in the context of servers in a cluster \cite{clark2005live} and enables administrators of clusters to perform maintenance tasks without interruption. On the other hand, migration techniques on mobile devices can help maintain consistent snapshots which allow easy transfer of data when users switch mobile phones and to roll-back the system to a previously known state.
